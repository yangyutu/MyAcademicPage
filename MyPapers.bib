abstract = {The ability to assemble nano- and micro- sized colloidal components into highly ordered configurations is often cited as the basis for developing advanced materials. However, the dynamics of stochastic grain boundary formation and motion have not been quantified, which limits the ability to control and anneal polycrystallinity in colloidal based materials. Here we use optical microscopy, Brownian Dynamic simulations, and a new dynamic analysis to study grain boundary motion in quasi-2D colloidal bicrystals formed within inhomogeneous AC electric fields. We introduce "low-dimensional" models using reaction coordinates for condensation and global order that capture first passage times between critical configurations at each applied voltage. The resulting models reveal that equal sized domains at a maximum misorientation angle show relaxation dominated by friction limited grain boundary diffusion; and in contrast, asymmetrically sized domains with less misorientation display much faster grain boundary migration due to significant thermodynamic driving forces. By quantifying such dynamics vs. compression (voltage), kinetic bottlenecks associated with slow grain boundary relaxation are understood, which can be used to guide the temporal assembly of defect-free single domain colloidal crystals.},

abstract = {We propose a Markov decision based dynamic programming method to manipulate the self-assembly of a quadrupole colloidal system for grain-boundary-free two-dimensional crystals. To construct the optimal control policy, we developed a Markov chain model, based on information extracted from a Langevin dynamics simulation model, which originated from a more complicated Brownian dynamics model. An infinite-horizon Markov decision process is defined, and the optimal control policy is solved with dynamic programming using policy iteration. Both the Markov chain Monte Carlo and the Langevin dynamics simulation results demonstrate that the control strategy is able to significantly accelerate the crystallization of a SiO2 colloidal self-assembly process for a grain-boundary-free, highly ordered crystal. Future work will focus on implementation of the control policy on the Brownian dynamics simulation and the experiments. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Automatic Control Council.},

abstract = {We report chemical antagonism between photodynamic agents and chemotherapeutics and provide a solution to turn antagonism into synergism. We report a photochemical reaction-induced antagonism between the photodynamic agent (PS) and anti-cancer drugs during combined therapy. The annihilation of singlet oxygen and alkene-containing drugs into inactive drug hydroperoxides is responsible for the antagonism, and results in decreased efficacy against several cancer cell lines. Experimental and simulation results reveal that the annihilation abates with increasing distance between the PS and drugs via confining the PS and drugs into separated vehicles. As a result, antagonism can be switched to synergism in treating both drug sensitive and resistant cancer cells. },

abstract = {We report an analytical model for energy landscapes of ellipsoidal particles in non-uniform high-frequency AC electric fields to identify all possible 3D positions and orientations. We report a closed-form analytical model for energy landscapes of ellipsoidal particles in non-uniform high-frequency AC electric fields to identify all possible particle positions and orientations. Three-dimensional equilibrium positions and orientations of prolate ( r x = r y {\textless} r z ), oblate ( r x = r z {\textgreater} r y ), and scalene ( r x ≠ r y ≠ r z ) ellipsoids are reported vs. field frequency and amplitude, which are determined from energy landscape minima. For ellipsoids within non-uniform electric fields between co-planar parallel electrodes, the number of configurations of position and orientation is 6 for prolate, 5 for oblate, and 9 for scalene ellipsoids. In addition, for coplanar electrodes, conditions are identified when particles can be treated using a quasi-2D analysis in the plane of their most probable elevation near an underlying surface. The reported expressions are valid for time-averaged interactions of ellipsoid particles in arbitrary AC electric field configurations, such that our results are applicable to electromagnetic tweezers interacting with particles having an appropriate material property contrast with the medium in the frequency range of interest. },

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Author(s).Here we construct a low-dimensional Smoluchowski model for electric field mediated colloidal crystallization using Brownian dynamic simulations, which were previously matched to experiments. Diffusion mapping is used to infer dimensionality and confirm the use of two order parameters, one for degree of condensation and one for global crystallinity. Free energy and diffusivity landscapes are obtained as the coefficients of a low-dimensional Smoluchowski equation to capture the thermodynamics and kinetics of microstructure evolution. The resulting low-dimensional model quantitatively captures the dynamics of different assembly pathways between fluid, polycrystal, and single crystals states, in agreement with the full N-dimensional data as characterized by first passage time distributions. Numerical solution of the low-dimensional Smoluchowski equation reveals statistical properties of the dynamic evolution of states vs. applied field amplitude and system size. The low-dimensional Smoluchowski equation and associated landscapes calculated here can serve as models for predictive control of electric field mediated assembly of colloidal ensembles into two-dimensional crystalline objects.},

@article{Bevan2015,
abstract = {A computational study is presented in which real-time manipulation of the interaction potential between particles in a colloidal system is used to control their assembly into a close-packed crystalline object. The basic model used throughout the study is a high-fidelity representation of a real experimental system in which 32 colloidal silica particles are suspended in aqueous solution with polymer hydrogel providing a temperature-tunable attractive force between the particles. Diffusion mapping is used to determine a set of coarse variables that provide an appropriate low-dimensional representation of this system at four discrete values of the attraction strength. In this case the diffusion mapping process identified two dimensions; one correlates well with the radius of gyration of the entire set of particles and the other correlates well with the average distance between distinct clusters of particles. Two different stochastic models are then built in the two-dimensional (2D) space of these variables, using data from a large number of short Brownian dynamics simulations of the full 32-particle system. The first 2D model is based on a Smoluchowski framework and is used to characterize the overall equilibrium and diffusive properties of the system. The second 2D model is based on a transition rate matrix and is used for process control. A control policy based on an infinite-horizon Markov decision process is developed using the four different attraction strengths as the input variables. The resulting policy is non-trivial; rather than simply selecting the strongest level of attraction, some mix of weak and strong attractions generally provides the optimal approach to the target close-packed state. This study, while focused on the particular mechanism of tunable depletion attraction, suggests a general strategy that could be adapted to different mechanisms of actuating colloidal assembly.},

abstract = {High-dimensional time-series data from a wide variety of domains, such as neuroscience, are being generated every day. Fitting statistical models to such data, to enable parameter estimation and time-series prediction, is an important computational primitive. Existing methods, however, are unable to cope with the high-dimensional nature of these data, due to both computational and statistical reasons. We mitigate both kinds of issues by proposing an M-estimator for Reduced-rank System IDentification (MR. SID). A combination of low-rank approximations, ℓ1 and ℓ2 penalties, and some numerical linear algebra tricks, yields an estimator that is computationally efficient and numerically stable. Simulations and real data examples demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in a variety of problems. In particular, we demonstrate that MR. SID can accurately estimate spatial filters, connectivity graphs, and time-courses from native resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging data. MR. SID therefore enables big time-series data to be analyzed using standard methods, readying the field for further generalizations including nonlinear and non-Gaussian state-space models.},
