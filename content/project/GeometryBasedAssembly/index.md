The ability to create multi-scale, periodic colloidal assemblies with unique properties is important to
emerging applications. Dynamically manipulating colloidal structures via tunable kT-scale attraction
can provide the opportunity to create particle-based nano- and microstructured materials that are
reconfigurable. Here, we report a novel tactic to obtain reconfigurable, multi-scale, periodic colloidal
assemblies by combining thermoresponsive depletant particles and patterned topographical features
that, together, reversibly mediate local kT-scale depletion interactions. This method is demonstrated
in optical microscopy experiments to produce colloidal microstructures that reconfigure between
well-defined ordered structures and disordered fluid states as a function of temperature and
pattern feature depth. These results are well described by Monte Carlo simulations using theoretical
depletion potentials that include patterned excluded volume. Ultimately, the approach reported here
can be extended to control the size, shape, orientation, and microstructure of colloidal assemblies on
multiple lengths scales and on arbitrary pre-defined pattern templates.
