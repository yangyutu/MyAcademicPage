## Summary
Artificial intelligence, including machine learning, has emerged as a trending technology that will have
fundamental impact on diverse fields, such as health, finance, robotics and etc. Since my research at
John Hopkins at PhD, I have been exploring the application of AI technology in solving biomedical
challenges - Autonomous navigation of micro-robots in human body. My endeavor in this field
continued after earning PhD degree, through collaboration with John Hopkins and Tsing Hua University.

## At Wells Fargo
I have been working as a quantitative associate at Wells Fargo since July 2017, as I was intrigued by the
elegance and power of mathematical finance. My accomplishment in this field can be found in my
finance book.


## Mathematical modeling
Applied math is always my passion. I have been taking on various mathematical modeling challenges
since undergrad. I had won top awards in series of most prestigious contests, both internationally and
domestically. My team was Outstanding Winner (ranked top 3 among 2,254 teams) in MCM
(Mathematical Contest in Modeling) of USA in 2010. I also won the First Class Prize in Undergraduate
Mathmatical Contest in Modeling in China and First Class Prize in Advanced Mathematics Contest in
Zhejiang Province in 2008 and 2009, respectively.
My pursuit in applied math and endeavors to thoroughly comprehend mathematical concepts and
modelling tools culminate in the book “Essentials of Mathematical methods”, which consists of more
than 50 chapters (2,000+ pages) surveying major aspects of applied math in science and engineering.
