## AI for colloidal robots
{{< figure library="true" src="robot/AIicon.png" title="" lightbox="true" >}}

Equipping micro-/nanoscale colloidal robots with artificial intelligence such that they can efficiently navigate in unknown complex environments could dramatically impact their use in emerging applications like precision surgery and targeted drug delivery. Here we develop a model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm that can train colloidal robots to learn effective navigation strategies in unknown environments with random obstacles. We employed a deep neural network archecture that enables the robot to mimic animal navigation decision-making by directly processing raw sensor input and decomposing long-range navigations to short-range ones. We show that trained robot agents learn to make navigation decisions regarding both obstacle avoidance and travel time minimization, based solely on local sensory inputs without prior knowledge of the global environment. Such agents with biologically inspired mechanisms can acquire competitive navigation capabilities in large-scale, complex environments containing obstacles of diverse shapes, sizes, and configurations. This study illustrates the potential of artificial intelligence to enable colloidal robots in extensive applications.
